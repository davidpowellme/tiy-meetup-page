##Homework Review
grid mixin with multiple breakpoints
- create a class system (bourgeois?)
- have a syntax that allows for changing size, etc.
- example: class="col-sm-6, col-md-4, col-lg-12"
    + allows you to change layout for breakpoints without fucking everything up
    + can't just use media queries

##Typography
Check the links/decks

##Pixels vs Em vs Rem vs Percentages
- pixels are fixed and not ideal for RWD
- ems inside ems multiply
- rems relative to document font-size
    + widely used
    + prevents accidental em multiplication
- percentages not as good for font-size
